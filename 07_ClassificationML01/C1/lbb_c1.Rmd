# Summmary
This LBB for Logistic Regression will use `lbb_loans.csv` dataset for a credit risk case or `wholesale.csv` dataset for customer segment prediction case.

# Library
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```


# Read Data
```{r}
loans <- read.csv("lbb_loans.csv")
ws <- read.csv("data_input/wholesale.csv")

str(loans)
str(ws)
```

```{r}
table(loans$not_paid)
```

# Predicting Credit Risk from Loans
```{r}
set.seed(100)
intrain <- sample(nrow(loans), nrow(loans) * 0.8)
loans.train <- loans[intrain, ]
loans.test <- loans[-intrain, ]

creditrisk <- glm(not_paid ~ )
```
