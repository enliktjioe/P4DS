# Introduction
Project "Kickstarter Explorer" is one of my data visualization projects during my boot camp in Indonesia. From this project, I learned more about exploratory data analysis and visualization technique.

# What is Kickstarter?
**Kickstarter** is American company based in New York, that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity and merchandising. The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life". Kickstarter has reportedly received more than $4 billion in pledges from 15.5 million backers to fund 257,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.

# Some things I want to analyze

- What types of projects were most popular?
- What types of projects were being funded?
- What types of projects were successful and unsuccessful?
- How many Successful and Failed Projects per Year?
