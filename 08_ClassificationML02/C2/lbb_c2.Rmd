# Introduction
Use any of the 3 classification algorithms youâ€™ve learned to predict the risk status of a bank loan. The variable *default* in the dataset indicates whether the applicant did default on the loan issued by the bank. Start by reading the loan.csv dataset in, a dataset that is originally from Professor Dr. Hans Hofmann:

DEFAULT = FAILURE
Artinya gagal bayar loan
```{r}
loans <- read.csv("data_input/loan.csv")
str(loans)
```

```{r}

```
